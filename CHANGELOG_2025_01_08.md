## Major Pro Sources Architecture Overhaul

### Problem Solved
- Pro users were experiencing "range() arg 3 must not be zero" errors for certain playlists
- Root cause: Database field `source_selection` was VARCHAR(20), too small for storing Pro users' multiple source selections as JSON arrays

### Solution Implemented
1. **Database Migration**:
   - Changed `source_selection` from VARCHAR(20) to TEXT
   - Added JSON serialization/deserialization for array storage
   - Created and ran migration script on production

2. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - Unified system where everything is a custom source for Pro users
   - Removed complex dual preset/custom source system
   - Pre-populate 7 suggested playlists on first Pro visit

## UI/UX Improvements

### Sources Page
- Fixed eye icon logic (was backwards):
  - Open green eye = source enabled
  - Closed red eye = source disabled
- Removed redundant success notifications when toggling
- Removed "Playlist" badge (all sources are playlists now)

### Create Page
- Redesigned Select All/Clear All buttons:
  - Changed from bulky buttons to subtle text links
  - Aligned with section heading
  - Added brand color hover effects

### Add Custom Source Page
- Increased padding and spacing throughout
- Better visual hierarchy with separators
- Less cramped, more professional appearance

## Content Updates

### Platform-Wide Changes
- Removed all references to "YouTube channels"
- Updated to "YouTube playlists" only
- Fixed time ranges: "2-4 weeks" instead of "1-90 days"
- Corrected Pro limits: "up to 20" not "unlimited"

### Pages Updated
- Landing page
- Guide page
- Terms of Service
- Subscription page
- FAQ section
